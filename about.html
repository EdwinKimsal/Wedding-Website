					<p id="long_txt" class="al_le">Elizabeth Grace was born in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania to her loving parents, Cynthia and Robert. She has three siblings, Robert, Valerie, and Jennifer. Liz was raised on Stoney Lane in Mountain Top where she maintains fantastic childhood memories of sledding on the pipeline, ultimate frisbee in the cul-de-sac, and hours and hours of adventures with her friends. Following the example of her siblings, Liz fulfilled her life-long dream of attending Penn State University, graduating with a degree in Civil Engineering. She now works as a structural engineer in Alpharetta, GA.</p><br>

					<p id="long_txt" class="al_le">Clayton Josiah was born in Kingston, Pennsylvania, the first-born son of his mother and father, Kelly and Vincent. He was later joined by his younger brother, Edwin. Clay grew up in Penn Lake Park where he spent his childhood riding his bike with friends, fishing for bass, and running up the hills of Hollenback Road (often to his parents' dismay). He never lets us forget that Pennsylvania is truly "home" when recalling memories of attending the Bloomsburg Fair with family, skating on the frozen lake, and his deep appreciation of the shared public land. Clay attended Penn State University graduating with a degree in Engineering. He now works as an energy consultant in Atlanta, GA.</p><br>

					<p id="long_txt" class="al_le">Clay and Liz began their relationship while attending Crestwood High School where they met running on the cross country team. They have been running after each other's love ever since! Later, Liz introduced Clay to the joys of college football. They faithfully cheer for the Nittany Lions and frequently attend football games with family and friends.</p><br>
					<p id="long_txt" class="al_le">Upon graduating college, the couple relocated to Georgia in pursuit of their respective careers. Liz and Clay are parishioners of St. Peter Chanel Catholic Church in Roswell, Georgia. In their free time, the couple enjoys spending time with their 3-year-old Boykin Spaniel, Woodstock, trying new recipes, and camping in north Georgia's wilderness.</p><br>
					<p id="long_txt" class="al_le">Clay and Liz engaged on May 22, 2025 on Kiawah Island, South Carolina. They are both delighted to be returning home to celebrate their nuptials!</p><br>
